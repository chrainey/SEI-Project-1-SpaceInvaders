Issues still to fix

Centralize the grid in center of screen







//Day One:

I decided to choose Space Invaders. At first I fancied tetris but when I looked at it it seemed very complicated 
for all the different shapes rotations and positions. PLus a massive grid.
I thopugh Space Invaders would be a good enough challenge

Did excalidraw of my whole plan. 

//DAy Two:

I really felt that last week crammed a lot in and i felt behind. I decided to take Saturday re watching
all of the functions, objects, methods and classes.

Day 3 :

Spent most of the day at Mcfly concert with girlfriend but found some good places to get sounds and images

Day 4 :

Rewatched lessons on whack a mole homework and grid movements




Day 5:



Day:6: Relaised using an array containing destroyed aliens can help me when setting new wave of enemies.
Had issue with ebvery keyboard button allowing a shoot. Also when spacebar to shoot it would destroy 2 enemies. This was because there was a shoot() lower in the function from a different way of doing it. Whne pressing spacebar i was actually firing 2 bullets but couldnt see tyhat as they were on top of oneanother

Got shooting mechanism,, for buillets to work. Needed set interval in there


Day 7

Enemies are moving as previously but they are getting destroyed properly
